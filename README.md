# UFO Sightings.

## Overview.
We are creating a functional website where users can go through a database of UFO sightings using filters by date/city/state/shape, etc.

## Results.
Its quite easy to perform a search, by entering a desired entry, for example state of california in a search window and pressing enter.

## Summery.

### Drawback.
I am not sure but i think this database wont be uploading automaticaly if new entries are added, so if that can be set up, then users will get the latest news.

### Suggestions.
Adding images can bring more traffic as they say "picture worth a thousand words" and make website in general more interesting, also adding articles or blogs about sightings can be beneficial for users as they wont need to leave website and "google" related info.
